# 🧠 Multi-Agentic Coding Framework using AutoGen & GPT-4

This project is a demonstration of a Generative AI system built using a **multi-agent architecture** coordinated by [AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) and powered by **OpenAI GPT-4**.

Each agent in this system plays a specific role in the software development lifecycle — starting from requirement analysis all the way to code generation, review, documentation, testing, deployment, and UI generation.

## 🚀 Features

- 📄 **Requirement Analysis Agent**: Converts natural language to structured software requirements.
- 👨‍💻 **Coding Agent**: Generates Python code based on the structured input.
- ✅ **Code Review Agent**: Provides iterative feedback on the code quality.
- 📝 **Documentation Agent**: Produces technical documentation with usage examples.
- 🧪 **Test Agent**: Auto-generates unit and integration test cases using `pytest`.
- 🚢 **Deployment Agent**: Creates a shell script to set up and run the project.
- 🌐 **Streamlit UI Agent**: Generates a simple frontend for user interaction.

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

```text
User Input (Natural Language)
         ↓
Requirement Analysis Agent
         ↓
     Coding Agent
         ↓
   ↳ Code Review Agent (loop until Approved)
         ↓
Documentation Agent → Test Agent → Deployment Agent → UI Agent
```

Agents are orchestrated in a pipeline using the `main.py` file, with each agent feeding its output into the next stage.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Create Environment

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\env\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set OpenAI API Key

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

You can also create a `.env` file to store it securely.

### 4. Run the Multi-Agent Pipeline

```bash
python main.py
```

Follow the prompts to enter a software requirement in plain English.

## 🧪 Running Tests

Tests are generated by the TestAgent and can be executed via:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

---

## 🌐 Running Streamlit UI

If you've generated a Streamlit app using the UI Agent, run:

```bash
streamlit run ui/streamlit_app.py
```

## 🔒 Notes on Safety

This application uses GPT-4 to interpret and evaluate Python code. Although it is sandboxed via the API, always review generated scripts before executing in sensitive environments.
